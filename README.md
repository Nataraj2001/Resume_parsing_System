# RESUME PARSING & RANKING SYSTEM
This project implements a resume parsing system leveraging machine learning techniques. The system is designed to automatically extract relevant information from resumes, such as education history, work experience, skills, and contact details, using advanced natural language processing algorithms. By employing machine learning models, the system continually learns and improves its accuracy in parsing diverse resume formats. This solution aims to streamline the recruitment process, saving time and effort for HR professionals and recruiters by automating the initial screening of candidates.
